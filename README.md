This repo is to research browser implementations of the Web SQL Database API, which is now no longer active
(http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/). That said, it's still being used for mobile development. I couldn't find any good
documentation, so I plan on writing my own. I'm posting this to Github to allow the community to toy with my test and
suggest better ones.
